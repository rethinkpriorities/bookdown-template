Note that this means this feature is not supported out of the box and that some setup is necessary if you start with a fresh install of the bookdown format. It is recommended to clone the files of this template so that you don’t have to worry about it. A foldable section can be created by placing text between two sets of three colons (:::) and specifying the .foldable class between two curly braces. In addition, you should add a line of HTML code to add a button that folds and unfolds the section. An example is shown below. ::: {.foldable} &lt;button class=&quot;fold-button&quot;&gt;Show me more&lt;/button&gt; This is a foldable section. ::: This creates the following foldable section: Show me more This is a foldable section. You can specify which text the button shows initially, but once you click on the button it will show “Show me less.” This text could be changed to something else in the header.html file that can be found in the html folder of the assets folder. The reason you have to specify the button itself is because of performance reasons. By putting the HTML code into the section itself, the text will be immediately shown to the user when a page is loaded. If we add the button using JavaScript, the label will initially not be shown and only show up after some (variable) time when the page is first opened. We have had some issues with multiple foldables in the past, so I include another one just for testing, and to show a ‘multi-line’ foldable with a different opening text. Do not open this foldable unless you want to hear about a lion ROAR samantha Dec 2013 The Lion &amp; the Lamb And so the lion fell in love with the lamb She thought she had the upper hand But fate got in the way And the lion had nothing to say So they began a life together Determined to last forever For their love was stronger than you would believe So intense it almost decieves But the lion couldn’t overcome All the obstacles to be with the one He left the lamb with tears in her eyes And wouldn’t return despite her tries Now the lamb couldn’t comprehend Why the lion wouldn’t spend A life time with her by his side the lion and his stupid pride But the lion soon came to regret The fact that he could ever let His precious lamb get away And now the lion knew what to say He needed his lamb and needed her bad See he missed the love that they had But the lamb did not forgive All that the lion did But she loved her lion, she couldn’t deny Even if she couldn’t explain why And so the lion fell in love with the lamb Stupid lion, stupid lamb From: https://hellopoetry.com/words/lion/ (we warned you) That’s foldables for ya. 3.1 What kind of content can foldables containt Can they contain: Inline r code?: try inline r code let’s try some 4 Footnotes?: try a footnote Here comes a footnote.1 itemized lists?: try a list Here comes a list item one item two second level Html commented out text?: try html comment more text Latex math bits like “\\(x^2\\)?”: try latex trying … \\(x^2\\)?
