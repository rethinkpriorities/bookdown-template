# Citations

It's possible to use citations with this template.

Our recommendation is to use Zotero and the Visual Editor in RStudio to insert a citation. In the Visual Editor, click on the Insert button and then on Citation to select a citation from your Zotero library. You can select one or more citations. Click on Insert to insert the citekey of the citation in the document. This will also create a new `.bib` file if the file did not exist yet or add it to the file if it did already exist.

You have to make sure that this file is also linked in the `YAML` options of `index.Rmd`.

Here's an example of a citation: [@alexander2019]

The main limitation of using citations this way is that the chapters have to be in the main folder (and not in a subfolder) because otherwise the bibliography path is not the same between the `index.Rmd` file and the chapter files, which throws the visual editor off.
