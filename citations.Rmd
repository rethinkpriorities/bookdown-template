# Citations

It's possible to use citations, although the current solution is not ideal yet. Our recommendation is to use the Zotero and the Visual Editor in RStudio to insert a citation. In the Visual Editor, click on the Insert button and then on Citation to select a citation from your Zotero library. You can select one or more citations. Once you have selected the citation, click on Insert to insert the citekey of the citation in the document. This will also create a new `.bib` file if the file did not exist yet or add it to the file if it did already exist.

You have to make sure that this file is also linked in the `YAML` options of `index.Rmd`.

Here's an example of a citation. @festingerTheoryCognitiveDissonance1957


## Offset quotes

I'm not sure these are working in the current style. Normally in bookdowns I type 
  
  ```
  > I am a quote 
  ```
  
and I get a nice grey offsetting thing with a vertical line displaying the whole quot. See, e.g., the content [HERE](https://daaronr.github.io/ea_giving_barriers/aware-distance.html#theoretical-and-conceptual-underpinning) 


Here it comes out as:

> I am a quote


As a workaround, we could indent texts or use the three backticks for quoted sections ... which gives it the same style as 'displaying literal code'. 



    This text was indented
    

Or I use the three backticks normally used for code

```
Does this look like a quote?
```
