# Footnotes

Footnotes are supported using the typical Markdown format:

`This sentence has a footnote.^[Here I am!]`

The result: This sentence has a footnote.^[Here I am!]

The footnotes are shown in-line using [bigfoot.js](http://www.bigfootjs.com). Simply click on the footnote to show a popover window that contains the footnote.
