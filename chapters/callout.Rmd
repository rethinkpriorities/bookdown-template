# Callout blocks

You can create a callout block by creating a custom block and giving it one of the following classes: `.rmdnote`, `.rmdimportant`, `.rmdcaution`, `.rmdwarning`, `.rmdtip`.

For example:

    ::: {.rmdnote}
    This is a callout block.
    :::

They look like this:

::: {.rmdnote}
This is a callout block.
:::

::: {.rmdimportant}
This one is for something positive, I guess?
:::

::: {.rmdcaution}
This is to indicate something bad!
:::

::: {.rmdwarning}
This is to cast a warning.
:::

::: {.rmdtip}
This one is for if you like this kind of blue, I suppose.
