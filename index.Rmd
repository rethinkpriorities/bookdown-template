## About {.unnumbered}

This book is a bookdown template to be used for various projects of the Rethink Priorities survey team. The main goal of this book is to serve as a skeleton project that can be copied and used in other projects. Additionally, it contains some chapters that serve as tutorials for different features of this bookdown format.
