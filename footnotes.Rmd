# Footnotes

Footnotes are supported using the typical Markdown format:

`This sentence has a footnote.^[Here I am!]`

The result: This sentence has a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: Here I am!

There are two ways that footnotes can be implemented in this template:

-   Standard footnotes

-   Footnotes using [littlefoot.js](https://github.com/goblindegook/littlefoot).

The benefit of using **littlefoot** is that footnotes show up in-text rather than at the bottom of the screen. Simply click on the footnote to show a popover window that contains the footnote.

You can change whether you want to use **littlefoot** by setting the `use_littlefoot` parameter in `index.Rmd` to either `true` or `false`.
