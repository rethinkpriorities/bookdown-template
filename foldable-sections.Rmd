    ::: {.foldable}

The Lion & the Lamb - samantha Dec 2013

And so the lion fell in love with the lamb 
She thought she had the upper hand 
But fate got in the way 
And the lion had nothing to say 
So they began a life together 
Determined to last forever 
For their love was stronger than you would believe 
So intense it almost deceives 
But the lion couldn't overcome 
All the obstacles to be with the one 
He left the lamb with tears in her eyes 
And wouldn't return despite her tries 
Now the lamb couldn't comprehend 
Why the lion wouldn't spend 
A life time with her by his side the lion and his stupid pride 
But the lion soon came to regret 
The fact that he could ever let 
His precious lamb get away 
And now the lion knew what to say 
He needed his lamb and needed her bad 
See he missed the love that they had 
But the lamb did not forgive 
All that the lion did 
But she loved her lion, she couldn't deny 
Even if she couldn't explain why 
And so the lion fell in love with the lamb 
Stupid lion, stupid lamb
