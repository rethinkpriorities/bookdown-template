# bookdown-template
The bookdown template used by the survey team of Rethink Priorities.

We previously used the gitbook template with some tufte elements (as in David Reinstein's template [here](https://github.com/daaronr/dr-rstuff/tree/master/bookdown_template))

We then tried an adaptation of the bs4 style (see earlier commits).

However, we are now back to using the gitbook style, mainly because it offers more flexibility, and does not tie us to having subsection headers on a left-hand-side outline.
